Changelog
===========

PreAlpha 0.1
------
__30.07.2013__  
Basic Code implemented.  
Randomlator supports 4 kinds of Arithmetic operations. UI is non-existant. If there would be 
a situation when a number would be divided by 0, the Program just cancels.
Aditionally, the Program stops after every calculation.

PreAlpha 0.1.1
-----
Divisions by zero are checked and if there is such a situation, another operation is chosen randomly.
